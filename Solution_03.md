### **Problem Statement**
Draw diagrams illustrating the various possibilities in Theorem 8.

**Theorem 8**: Let $PQR$ and $P^{\prime}Q^{\prime}R^{\prime}$ be triangles in $E^{2}$. Suppose $\overleftrightarrow{PP^{\prime}}$, $\overleftrightarrow{QQ}^{\prime}$, and $\overleftrightarrow{RR}^{\prime}$ meet in $X$. Then the conclusions of Theorem 7 hold (Desargues' Theorem in $E^2$).

### **Diagram**

The following diagram illustrates the general case where the center of perspectivity $X$ is a finite point, and the axis of perspectivity (containing $L, M, N$) is a finite line.

**Possibilities:**
1.  **General Case:** $X$ is finite, Axis is finite. (Shown above).
2.  **Parallel Case:** $X$ is at infinity (lines $PP', QQ', RR'$ are parallel).
3.  **Axis at Infinity:** The corresponding sides are parallel ($PQ \parallel P'Q'$, etc.).

The diagram above captures the essence of the concurrency at $X$ and collinearity of intersections.
