### **Exercises**

1.  Prove Theorem 3. 
2.  Let $x=(1,0,0)$, $y=(1,1,0)$, $z=(1,0,1)$, $w=(1,1,1).$ Let $l$ be the line joining $x$ and $y$, and let $m$ be the line joining $z$ and $w$. Find $l\cap m$.

4.  Draw a diagram illustrating Theorem 9. 
5.  Draw a diagram illustrating Theorem 10. 
6.  Pappus' theorem yields many distinct results in $E^{2}$ depending on the position of $l_{\infty}$. State as many of these results as you can. 
7.  Let $l$ and $l'$ be distinct lines, and let $C$ be a point not on either line. The perspectivity $[C; l \to l']$ is the mapping $\alpha$ that sends each point $P\in l$ to the intersection of $\overleftrightarrow{PC}$ with $l'$.     * **i.** Verify that the mapping $\alpha$ is well-defined.     * **ii.** Verify that $\alpha$ is a bijection with exactly one fixed point.     * **iii.** Verify that $\alpha^{-1}$ is a perspectivity.     * **iv.** Show that the composition of two perspectivities need not be a perspectivity.     * **v.** Given four distinct points $P$, $Q$, $P'$, and $Q'$, prove that there is a unique perspectivity taking $P$ to $P'$ and $Q$ to $Q'$. 
8.  A projectivity is a composition of finitely many perspectivities. Each projectivity relates a pair of (not necessarily distinct) lines. For each line $l$, prove that the set of all projectivities that take $l$ to itself is a group. With respect to an appropriate choice of homogeneous coordinates, find a matrix representation for this group. 
9.  Let $P$, $Q$, and $R$ be distinct points on a line $l$, and let $P'$, $Q'$, and $R'$ be distinct points on a line $l'$. Prove that there is a unique projectivity sending $P$ to $P'$, $Q$ to $Q'$, and $R$ to $R'$. 
10. If $l$ and $l'$ are distinct in Exercise 9, show that the required projectivity may be expressed as the product of two perspectivities. 
11. Show that any projectivity is the product of three or fewer perspectivities. 
12. Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be four collinear points. Show that there is a unique projectivity that interchanges $A$ and $B$ and also interchanges $C$ and $D$. 
13. Show that a projectivity relating distinct lines is a perspectivity if and only if it has a fixed point. 
14. Classify the projectivities of a given line $l$ in terms of their fixed point behavior. 
15. Prove that a projective collineation that leaves fixed four points, no three of which are collinear, must be the identity. (Hint: Choose $l_{\infty}$ to be one of the fixed lines, and apply Theorem 2.2 to $P^{2}-l_{\infty}.$) 16. Prove the uniqueness part of Theorem 11: there is only one projective collineation relating two specified quadrangles. 
17. Prove that every projective collineation is of the form $\tilde{A}$ for some $A\in GL(3)$. 
18. The fixed lines of a projective collineation $\tilde{A}$ can be found by computing the eigenvectors of $A^{t}$. Justify this statement and use it to prove Theorem 12. 
19. Prove Theorem 13. 
20. If $T$ is a projective collineation, prove that the restriction of $T$ to one line $l$ is a projectivity. Prove also that every projectivity arises in this way. 
21. Prove Theorem 14. 
22. Show that the transformation of Theorem 14 preserves the relationships $(a-1)x_{1}+px_{3}=0$ and $(c-1)x_{2}+qx_{3}=0$, in addition to preserving the line $x_{3}=0$. Thus, unless $a=c=1$, there is an additional fixed line. Use this to prove Theorem 15. 
23. Prove Theorem 16 and its corollary. 
24. Prove Theorem 17. 
25. Prove Theorem 18. 
26. A perspective collineation induces a projectivity on any fixed line. Discuss the fixed point behavior of such a projectivity. 
27. Show that the set of perspective collineations with a given axis and center (with the identity thrown in) is a group. Do these groups have any finite subgroups? 
28. (Sub-problems regarding Theorem 18):
    * **i.** Verify the remarks following Theorem 18.     * **ii.** Show that the harmonic homologies are those having $a=-1$ and $q=0$ in Theorem 18.     * **iii.** Prove that the only projective collineations that are involutions are the harmonic homologies. 
29. When $l_{\infty}$ is taken to be the axis of a harmonic homology, what affine transformation of $P^{2}-l_{\infty}$ results? 
30. (Harmonic Homology properties):
    * **i.** Prove that there is a unique harmonic homology with a given center and axis.     * **ii.** If $\alpha$ is a harmonic homology with center $P$ and axis $l$, and $\beta$ is a harmonic homology with center $Q$ and axis $m$, prove that $\alpha\beta=\beta\alpha$ if and only if $Q$ lies on $l$ and $P$ lies on $m$. 
31. Prove Theorem 19. 
32. Prove Theorem 20. 
33. Let $\tilde{b}$ be a polarity, and let $l$ be a non-self-conjugate line. For each $X\in l$, let $\alpha(X)$ be the point where the polar line of $X$ intersects $l$. Prove that $\alpha$ is a projectivity. Show further that $\alpha^{2}=I$, that is, $\alpha$ is an involution. 
34. Prove Theorem 23. 
35. Prove Theorem 25.
